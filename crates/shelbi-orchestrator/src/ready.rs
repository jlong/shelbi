//! Shared "wait for claude to be ready to type" helpers.
//!
//! Both the workspace dispatch path and the review-pane launch face the
//! same hazard: after we `send_line` the launch command, claude takes a
//! variable amount of time to draw its input box, and on first entry to an
//! untrusted directory tree it interposes a "trust this folder" dialog. A
//! fixed sleep either wastes time on a fast host or — worse — types the
//! prompt into the trust dialog / scrollback on a slow/fresh/remote pane,
//! where the first Enter just confirms trust and the prompt is lost.
//!
//! So instead of sleeping we poll the pane until it shows the input box,
//! auto-confirming the trust dialog along the way. Extracted here so the
//! review flow reuses exactly the same detection the dispatch flow uses.

///
/// ## Why this exists / what the bug actually was
///
/// The original code slept a fixed 1500ms then typed. That fails on a
/// fresh devbox workspace for a reason that is *not* terminal encoding:
/// investigation on a Linux workspace showed claude emits the `❯` prompt glyph
/// (`e2 9d af`) under both `en_US.UTF-8` and the bare `C` locale, and
/// `tmux capture-pane` preserves those bytes intact. So a single-glyph probe
/// matches fine on Linux — encoding is a red herring.
///
/// The real fragility is twofold:
///  1. `❯` is *ambiguous*: it is also the menu cursor in claude's modal
///     dialogs (`❯ 1. Yes, I trust this folder`), so a probe keyed on the
///     glyph alone can fire on a dialog instead of the input box.
///  2. On first entry to an untrusted directory tree claude shows a "trust
///     this folder" dialog and waits. The hub rarely sees it (its work_dir
///     tree is already trusted), but a fresh devbox does — and a fixed sleep
///     types the task body straight into that dialog, where the first Enter
///     just confirms trust and the prompt is lost.
///
/// So we (a) auto-confirm the trust dialog (shelbi owns these worktrees, so
/// trusting them is implied by the assignment) and (b) key readiness on
/// signals unique to the *input box*, never present in a modal menu.
