//! Verified-submit: the one way text goes into a worker pane.
//!
//! Every injection path — task dispatch, supervision re-injection after an
//! auto-restart, `shelbi send`, and any future nudge/resume mechanism — has
//! the same failure mode: the text lands in claude's input box but the
//! trailing Enter is consumed as part of the bracketed paste, so the prompt
//! sits un-submitted until a human presses Enter (observed 2026-07-12 on
//! alpha for a mid-task orchestrator note; earlier for dispatch and the
//! post-restart re-injection). The dispatch path grew a submit-verification
//! probe fix by fix; this module is that probe extracted into a shared
//! primitive so no injection path has to reimplement (or forget) it.
//!
//! The shape of a verified send:
//!
//! 1. Snapshot a [`PaneBaseline`] BEFORE delivering anything — was the pane
//!    already mid-turn, did the title already carry `shelbi:working`? Both
//!    poison the corresponding submit signals for THIS delivery.
//! 2. Deliver the text WITHOUT its Enter ([`shelbi_tmux::send_text`]), let
//!    the pane settle, then send Enter as a separate key event
//!    ([`deliver_text`]) — an Enter riding the same instant as the paste is
//!    exactly the keystroke that gets eaten.
//! 3. Poll for proof of submission ([`verify_submitted`]): title marker
//!    flipping to `shelbi:working`, busy spinner/footer in the pane body, or
//!    the input box no longer holding the text. If nothing lands and the
//!    text is visibly parked in the box, retry Enter once and poll again.
//!
//! Claude's UI exposes enough stable evidence for Shelbi to verify and retry a
//! submit. Other runners still use the same text → settle → separate-Enter
//! delivery sequence, but return [`SubmitStatus::DeliveredUnverified`] instead
//! of being inspected with Claude-specific screen parsing. This capability
//! gate preserves safe delivery for Codex and custom runners without inventing
//! false `stuck` verdicts from UI chrome they do not render.
//!
//! The result is a [`SubmitStatus`] the caller maps to its own events.log
//! vocabulary (`dispatch … status=confirmed`, `send … status=submitted`),
//! so a stuck Claude prompt is surfaced instead of silently waiting for a
//! human keypress.
//!
//! `shelbi message` is intentionally outside this module's scope. It injects
//! no terminal text or Enter: it appends a durable JSON record that runner
//! hooks consume and acknowledge by `msg_id`. Sending that body here as well
//! would duplicate delivery and weaken the restart-safe message channel.

///    matters for sends to existing panes: an idle worker's title still
///    carries the `shelbi:idle` its Stop hook wrote after the previous turn.
///
/// 2. **Pane content shows claude is actively processing.** When the text
///    has been submitted and claude is working, the pane renders a spinner
///    line like `· Booping… (10s · ↑ 2k tokens)` and an `esc to interrupt`
///    footer — none of which appear in the empty-input state. Suppressed
///    when the baseline was already busy: on a `--continue` resume the
///    replayed scrollback carries old token footers, and on a mid-turn
///    message the pane is busy with the PREVIOUS prompt — either way a busy
///    match is not proof THIS text landed.
///
/// 3. **The input box no longer holds our text.** After we type + Enter, a
///    cleared box is direct proof it was consumed. This closes the
///    false-positive gap: claude's *earliest* spinner (the first second or
///    two, before any tokens stream) matches none of the busy markers in
///    (2), so a text that submitted and started working could otherwise
///    slip past both (1) and (2) and get a spurious `enter-stalled`.
///    "Cleared" excludes a collapsed `[Pasted text …]` chip
///    ([`input_box_cleared`] / [`input_holds_unsubmitted_prompt`]): a chip
///    is an un-submitted prompt whose body claude never echoes, so counting
///    it as cleared is precisely the auto-restart false positive this
